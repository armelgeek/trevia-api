# Product Owner Task Sequence – Trevia Frontend

## 1. Project Initiation Phase
- Organize stakeholder alignment sessions to clarify business goals and define success metrics
- Review and validate all API documentation (`endpoints-summary.md`) and technical requirements
- Establish clear, testable acceptance criteria for each functional module (refer to UI mapping in `todo.md`)
- Define sprint cadence (e.g., 2-week sprints) and set key development milestones

## 2. Planning & Prioritization
- Write detailed user stories for each API endpoint and UI component (cross-reference `endpoints-summary.md` and `todo.md`)
- Prioritize features by business value, user impact, and technical dependencies
- Build a risk assessment matrix (integration, auth, performance, UX, etc.)
- Define QA protocols: test coverage targets, review process, and acceptance testing requirements

## 3. Development Oversight
- Set up daily standups and bi-weekly sprint reviews for progress tracking
- Monitor API integration and UI progress against the component mapping (see `todo.md`)
- Validate state management and data flow implementation (Redux/Zustand/Pinia, etc.)
- Coordinate with backend for API changes, blockers, and cross-team dependencies

## 4. Quality Assurance
- Define and enforce automated testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E) for critical user journeys
- Establish performance benchmarks (load times, responsiveness, error rates)
- Plan and schedule user acceptance testing (UAT) with key stakeholders
- Maintain a log of known issues, blockers, and their resolution timelines

## 5. Deployment & Monitoring
- Create a phased rollout plan (feature flags, canary releases)
- Set up production monitoring and alerting (Sentry, Datadog, custom dashboards)
- Define KPIs for post-launch evaluation (adoption, conversion, NPS, error rates)
- Schedule regular retrospectives and continuous improvement cycles
